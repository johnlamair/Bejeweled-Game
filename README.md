Similar to Bejeweled or Candy Crush, players swap colored gems create rows or columns of similar colors. They're awarded points based on the number of tiles cleared, with a score multiplier added if one move clears multiple rows. The player has 45 seconds to clear as many tiles as they can, advancing to more difficult rounds if a sufficient score is reached.
